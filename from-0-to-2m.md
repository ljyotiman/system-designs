Delayed Gratification
- Don't start monetizing immediately, build value for users and wait for long enough before start monitization.
- More risks you take, luckier you get. You need to know that you might lose everything in your attempts, but you have to take risks in order to become luckier and build everything again.

Do not let things own you
- Success is accepting failure, embracing it and then overcoming it
- You have to learn to lose things, and let go ego.
- Let them underestimate you, learn to be a D student. That's why 80% of A students end up working for D people.
- Take your time.
